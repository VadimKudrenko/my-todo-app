## 🛠️ Technologies Used

### Core
- **React** (v18+) – UI library
- **TypeScript** (v5+) – Type safety
- **SCSS** – Component-based styling

### Data Handling
- **External REST API** – Used for fetching, updating, and deleting todos
- **Axios** – For performing HTTP requests

### UI/UX
- **Transition Group** – It is used to implement smooth animations during any interactions with todos.

### Development & Deployment
- **Vite** – Build tool
- **ESLint** – Code quality & linting
- **GitHub Pages** – Hosting and deployment

## ✨ Features

- **Classic Todo**:  Users can add new tasks, edit existing ones, and remove any todo items at any time.

- **Filter todos by status**: Filter the list to show all tasks, only completed, or only active todos.

- **Server-side persistence**: All todos are stored on a remote server and persist even after a page reload.

- **Toggle completion status**: Each todo has a status that allows users to mark it as completed or return it to active.

- **Real-time UI updates**: The interface immediately reflects changes like status toggles, additions, or deletions based on API responses.

- **Minimalistic and pleasant design**: The layout responds to every user action with smooth animations that improves the user experience.
